# To-do List

We often have a number of data-management tasks that are unfinished \(as with every digital humanities project\). We keep track of those here, so that the public can see the status of our corpus.

* [ ] Document the data from PLoS, JSTOR, and the Complexity journals, convert all into canonical JSON
* [ ] Build proper workflows for updating PLoS and the Complexity journals \(this will involve standardizing and publishing the scrapers as well\)

Other data sources that we would soon like to investigate:

* [ ] Funded grant proposal databases \(NSF, ERC, others?\)
* [ ] After TREE processing, more journals from Elsevier TDM API

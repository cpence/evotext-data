# Home

Welcome to the data documentation repository for Sciveyor. This documentation tracks the current status of all journals that can be found in Sciveyor, provides information about their copyrights and derivation, and documents the workflows that we use to keep them running.

_Looking for evoText?_ The evoText project is currently in the middle of a rebrand and upgrade, and will be re-released as Sciveyor shortly. Our data documentation website is the first piece of our system to be renamed.

The overall layout of the documentation is as follows. You'll find general information about our schema and data formats that we use at rest \(which, in turn, governs what kinds of textual analyses we are able to perform\). For each source of data that we have \(each journal or collection of journals\), you'll find details about how we got access to it and how it's been processed from its original formats. Several of those technical processing steps are, in turn, documented in further detail. Finally, you'll find meta-level information about this documentation, including its changelog and our current data-related to-do lists.

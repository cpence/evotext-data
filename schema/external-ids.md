# External IDs

This page will list all known external ID types that might appear in the `externalIds` value for a document. These are intended to capture the ones we know about, but should _not_ be taken as an exhaustive list. It's better for data integration to keep an ID we don't know that we need, even if it winds up going unused in the long run.

* `pubmed`: A PMID value, which is simply a large integer.
* `scopus`: A Scopus ID value, which is simply a large integer.
* `semanticScholar`: a Semantic Scholar identifier, which is a 40-character hex string.
